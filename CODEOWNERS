# CODEOWNERS
# This file defines the final approvers (Core Maintainers) for all code in this org.
# Note: "Require review from Code Owners" must be enabled in branch protection for this to take effect.

# Apply to all files in all repos by default
*       @core-maintainers

# Later on for per-folder ownership, extended to scale up the team:
# src/api/       @api-maintainers
# src/frontend/  @frontend-maintainers
# docs/          @docs-team
